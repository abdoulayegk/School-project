# School-projects
The school management system software project that I made using csv python module for origanizing data in a very structured way by storing it into a csv files.
In this project I make the software to handle following operations:
1.  Add New Student
2.  View Students
3.  Search Student
4.  Update Student
5.  Delete Student
6.  Add faculty Member
7.  View Faculty Member
8.  Search Faculty Memeber
9.  Update Faculty Member
10. Delete Faculty Member
11. Quit
Here you have the option to choose which operation to perform and after doing any operation, the programme will store all the data in a csv file in a well organised 
way.
After each operation you are free to perform multiple operations at the same time like recording a student and a faculty.
Everyone is free to contribute to improve this project.
